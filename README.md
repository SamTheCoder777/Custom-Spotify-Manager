## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

I am a music listener just like everyone and I listen to them whenever I am working, reading, studying or gaming. I created this program because I wanted to have more control over Spotify and personalize it to the fullest. I have always wanted to enjoy playlists that actually have diverse songs from different artists and Spotify's own auto personalized playlists always failed to achieve that. They were always so unpolished out, they recommend songs that were obviously out of place and sometimes it was so random I did not know how they came up with it. Because of all these reasons, I decided to create a program that will achieve a goal of recommending me songs of a specific genre anytime I wanted. In addition to this, I always wanted a feature that will allow me to mix and match songs from multiple playlists and randomize them so I do not have to manually add songs from different playlists to one playlist. I have been coding since few years ago and this is my first ever serious project that I have decided to work on and finish it. Because of this, I am very much proud of this project and hopefully you will enjoy it as well. I will keep updating this project whenever I have time or have a need for a new feature.
